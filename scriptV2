    "Welcome to the city of Dorado!" "You, along with your four friends will embark on a journey to save your neighborhood from developers trying to repurpose the area."

label expo:
    "You and your friends are hanging out in your favorite spot in Dorado Park, when you see a sign that reads “Closing Soon. Area Soon To Be Demolished.”"

    Dio "You guys hear?"
    Bruno "Yeah, it doesn't feel real."
    Inez "I keep thinking it’s not actually going to happen."
    Sol "What are we even gonna do once it's gone?"
    Bruno "Maybe it doesn’t have to go though."
    Sol "What do you mean?"
    Bruno "Have you guys ever heard of that really old story that when this town was founded someone hid a bunch of gold somewhere?"
    Inez "Gold? Like real gold? What would we even do with that?"
    Dio "We could buy out the developers! If we had enough money. That could work right?"
    Bruno "I mean, we have to do something. We have to try."
    Sol "I think we should too, but where would we start? I’m sure we aren’t the first to look for the gold. People have to know about the legend."
    Inez "We could ask Doña Ofelia! She might know."
    Sol "Why? Cuz she’s old?"
