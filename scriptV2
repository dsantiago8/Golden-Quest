    Dio "You guys hear?"
    Bruno "Yeah, it doesn't feel real."
    Inez "I keep thinking it’s not actually going to happen."
    Sol "What are we even gonna do once it's gone?"
    Bruno "Maybe it doesn’t have to go though."
    Sol "What do you mean?"
    Bruno "Have you guys ever heard of that really old story that when this town was founded someone hid a bunch of gold somewhere?"
    Inez "Gold? Like real gold? What would we even do with that?"
    Dio "We could buy out the developers! If we had enough money. That could work right?"
    Bruno "I mean, we have to do something. We have to try."
    Sol "I think we should too, but where would we start? I’m sure we aren’t the first to look for the gold. People have to know about the legend."
    Inez "We could ask Doña Ofelia! She might know."
    Sol "Why? Cuz she’s old?"
    Inez "Well that helps, but she kinda just seems to know everything. She has to know something about the gold, right?"
    Dio "Well we’ll start there then."
    Bruno "What do you think, [pname]?"
    pov "Yeah, let’s go!"
    "Exposition" "You guys leave the park, and head to Doña Ofelia’s home on Brand Street near Old Town. You knock on the door, and she answers with a smile. You ask if she knows anything about the gold, and she invites you guys in."
    Dio "We’re sorry to bother out of the blue."
    Sol "Yeah, we can imagine a lot of people come to ask you about the gold."
    Ofelia "No no, I’m happy to have visitors. People don’t come by anymore to ask about the gold."
    Bruno "Did they used to?"
    Ofelia "They did a few years back when the mall first opened, and rumors went around that the developers wouldn’t touch Dorado until the gold was found."
    Inez "Why?"
    Ofelia "I couldn’t tell you. Why does anyone go looking for gold?"
    pov "We thought that if we found it we might be able to save Dorado."
    Ofelia "You kids shouldn’t have to worry about your home being taken away."
    Dio "Do you know where we might look for the gold?"
    Ofelia "I don’t, but you might want to start by looking into the old El Pescador restaurant. The owner is the grandson of the man who is believed to have hidden the gold."
    pov "What 's El Pescador?"
    Ofelia "You’re too young to have known it, but it was a very beloved restaurant run by a wonderful family that had been one of the first families in Dorado. I have a clipping of the article about the restaurant when it first opened."
    Sol "Really? That must have been a long time ago."
    Ofelia "It was. I don’t know if it’ll be of any use, but I’ll let you have it."
    "Exposition: You thank Doña Ofelia for her help, and you and your friends leave. You try to read the article, but some words are hard to makeout due to the paper’s old age."
